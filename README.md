bitstream-io (async mod)
========================

A Rust library for reading or writing binary values to or from streams
which may not be aligned at a whole byte.

This library is intended to be flexible enough to wrap
around any stream which implements the `AsyncRead` or `AsyncWrite` traits.
It also supports a wide array of integer data types as
containers for those binary values.
